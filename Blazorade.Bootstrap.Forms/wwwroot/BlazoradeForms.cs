	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The purpose of these extensions is to encourage code quality by keeping the C# wrappers as
	/// close to the javascript implementations as possible. Otherwise, it's too easy to loose track
	/// of where c#/javascript methods are implemented.
	///
	/// These methods are only intended to use by classes inside this library. If public access is
	/// required, expose a method on the relevant Forms control.
